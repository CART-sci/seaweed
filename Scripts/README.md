### Scripts Folder Structure

**`seaweed_map.Rmd` creates a global map showing:**

1. Areas of N:P suitable for seaweed growth  
2. Native ranges of wild seaweeds  
3. Countries that are currently farming seaweed  
4. How much area is needed to farm seaweed under three offset scenarios

**`nutrient_maps.Rmd`**
- creates Supplemental figures 1 and 2 which show seasonal patterns in nitrogen and phosphate

**`hypo_eut_map.Rmd`**
- creates a map showing regions of the world where acidic conditions exist (aragonite saturation state <= 3), along with specific sites identified as either Eutrophic or Hypoxic. At the end of this script, multiple statistics are run to glean information about countries that are suitable for seaweed farming. For example, how many countries that have been identified as suitable for seaweed farming are also experiencing hypoxic, eutrophic AND acidic conditions? (Hint it's 24).
